The significant health issues among the present generation individuals are eye ailments. One of the most important internal components in eye is called retina. 
Retina located in the back of the eye is not only a vital part of human sight, but also contains valuable information that can be used in biometric security applications, 
or for the diagnosis of certain diseases. In this paper, we detect the blood vessels present in the retina and also analyse the various aspects of ophthalmological or ocular 
ailments such as ocular dysfunctional retinopathy, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. 
We used RGB image for obtaining the traces of blood vessels. We proposed a method to detect blood vessels consists of three phases, Pre- processing, Vesselness Filter and Vessel 
detection. Also, we proposed an algorithm for detection of diseases in retinal images consists of four main steps: Pre-processing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction and Classifier.
The performance of algorithms is compared and analysed on an average basis, and can be comparable to existing ones.
